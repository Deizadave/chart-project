# Datahawk Best Selling Product rank viewer module

This project is being submitted as a solution to the DataHawk Senior Frontend home project.

## UI/UX improvement suggestions

* Users should be able to select the range of ranks to display on the chart. This has been implemented.
* When a dataset element is hovered, all other other elements can be made to have a lesser opacity, thus increasing focus on the hovered element.
* Users could be given the option of selecting either a light or dark theme because some users may prefer one over the other on busy screens.
